End-to-End Blueprint: Self-Service Translation & Entity-Extraction on Azure AI

This is a battle-tested, production-ready pattern that turns a customer-uploaded Excel workbook into a translated & enriched workbook with new columns for:

üåç Country

üìû Phone

üìñ Book ("Gyan Ganga" / "Way of Living")

üè∑Ô∏è Language mentioned in the text

1. High-Level Architecture
#	Component	Why we need it
1	Azure Blob Storage (incoming/, processed/)	Landing zone for the uploaded .xlsx + destination for the enriched output file
2	Event Grid	Fires downstream workflow when a new file lands in incoming/
3	Azure Function (Python)	Serverless brain:
‚ë† Reads Excel sheet
‚ë° Calls Azure Translator
‚ë¢ Calls Azure OpenAI for entity extraction
‚ë£ Writes enriched output
4	Azure AI Translator	Fast, low-cost, enterprise-grade language translation ‚Üí English
5	Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o, JSON mode)	One-shot entity extraction ‚Üí no custom ML training required
6	(Optional) Power Automate / Logic Apps	If you want a no-code pipeline instead of an Azure Function
2. Flow (Step by Step)

Upload workbook ‚Üí Blob Storage /incoming/

Event Grid notices new file ‚Üí triggers Function

Azure Function

Loads the Excel file with openpyxl/pandas

Calls Translator ‚Üí translate text to English

Calls OpenAI GPT-4o (JSON mode) ‚Üí extract entities (country, phone, book, language)

Writes enriched workbook ‚Üí Blob Storage /processed/

(Optional) Notify user via Power Automate (email/Teams/Slack) with the processed file link

3. Tech Stack

Compute: Azure Function App (Python 3.12)

Storage: Azure Blob Storage (hot tier, incoming + processed containers)

Events: Event Grid (BlobCreated trigger)

AI Services:

Azure AI Translator (standard tier, pay-per-character)

Azure OpenAI (GPT-4o, JSON mode)

Optional Integration: Power Automate / Logic Apps for no-code orchestration

CI/CD: GitHub Actions ‚Üí auto-deploy Function code

Secrets: Managed Identity + App Service Configuration

4. Cost Model (‚ö° pay-as-you-go, low)

Blob Storage: fractions of a cent per GB/month for Excel files

Event Grid: first 100K ops/month free

Azure Function: Free 1M executions/month, then ~$0.20 per extra million

Translator: Free 2M chars/month, then ~$10 per extra million chars

Azure OpenAI: depends on model (GPT-4o JSON ~$0.002‚Äì0.005 per 1K tokens)

Optional Power Automate: Free basic tier, paid if enterprise connectors
